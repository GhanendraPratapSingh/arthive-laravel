                          <h2>CONSENT</h2>
                          <p> How do you get my consent? 
                            When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit 
                            card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent

                            ask you directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.  </p>

                           <h2>DISCLOSURE </h2>
                          <p> We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you 
                            violate our Terms of Service. 
                           </p>

                           <h2> PAYMENT</h2>
                         <p>We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your card data on 
                            their servers. The data is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security 
                            Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your purchase transaction data is only used 
                            as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your 
                            purchase transaction information is not saved. 
                            </p>

                           <p>Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI 
                            Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American 
                            Express and Discover. 
                            </p>


                               <p>PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our 
                                store and its service providers. For more insight, you may also want to read terms and

                                   <h2>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES </h2>

                                   <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your 
                                    information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.
                                    However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other 
                                    payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information 
                                    we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions. 
                                     </p>
                                     <p>For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can 
                                        understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these 
                                        providers. </p>

                                        <p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are 
                                            located a different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a 
                                            transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information 
                                            may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its 
                                            facilities are located. </p>
